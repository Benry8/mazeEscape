# Maze Escape 

MazeEscape is a c++ game, developed using openGL and openAL libraries. It was made as a university project. To win the game the player must move in a 3d maze to reach a defined number of green columns (alarms) to disable them. If all of them are disabled within 100 seconds, the player wins the game. Otherwise, a game over screen is displayed. Be free to extend this project or to use it to understand openGl library (glut) and openAL library (alut).
